# Buddha-Dharma.org is a free open source site connecting practitioners
I have started Buddha-Dharma.org to connect with other practicioners and provide a collection of free resources.
Part of the project is translating http://www.starting-meditation.com/ to different languages.
My hope is that small groups can form and organize in our communities.

The source code and content for the site are available online https://github.com/buddha-dharma/website and I will
accept good pull requests. I will also accept people into the organisation once I know they can produce good pull requests.

The page and content are in the very early stages. I am looking forward to hearing your feedback.
