# Buddha-Dharma.org is free open source site connecting practicioners
I have started Buddha-Dharma.org to connect with other practicioners and provide a collection of free resources.
Part of the project is translating http://www.starting-meditation.com/ to different languages.

I am looking forward to hearing your feedback.
